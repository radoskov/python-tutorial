    "For those who don't know, this is what is called a \"Jupyter notebook\". It is kind of like a web page that a mixes code and markdown formatted text. It is divided into \"cells\". Each cell can be either text cell (using markdown format) or code cell, containing executable Python code. When executed, the text cells simply render the formatted text. However, the code cells will actually run the code and print the result below that cell.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Important to keep in mind is that actual Python \"kernel\" is running in the background. Whatever you run, \"stays\" in the kernel (until it is stopped or restarted). For example, if you run a cell defining a variable `a = 3`, you can then use the variable in another cell, e.g., `b = a + 5` (without redefining it in that cell). However, the order of the cells in the document does not matter. What matters is the order in which you execute the cells. Therefore, if you run the cell containing `b = a + 5` before the cell containing `a = 3`, it will throw an error stating that variable `a` does not exist. Likewise, if you execute another cell with `a = 7`, it will rewrite the value of `a` and thus `b = a + 5` will result in `b` having a different value.  \n",
    "Keep this in mind when executing individual cells. My recommendation is to always run the cells in consecutive order and re-run them from the beginning again, if you close a file and open it later.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, we will use the `print()` function heavily. It simply prints whatever is in the brackets. Either a direct value or a result of an operation. E.g., `print(5 + a * 2)` will print `11` below the cell (provided a==3). Multiple prints within the same cell are simply stacked one after another.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because it is \"a live code\", you can also modify it, play with it, to explore the examples yourself. Hopefully, this will help you understand everything more.\n",
    "\n",
    "I hope everything is clear and it will prove useful to you."
